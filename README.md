# 3D Design File for Virtual Reality Motorized Shoe

**Note: This is a work in progress**

The vr-shoe is a "shoe" or platform that straps to each of your feet. The shoes function like a treadmill where as you walk you stay i the same location. With a treadmill you can only walk forward and backward, but with the vr shoes you can turn, walk, and strafe in any direction.

The the vr shoes, along with a vr headset and saftey harness, are intended to be used while playing a vr game so that you can walk infintely in the game while staying in the same spot physically.

The design file is for [DesignSpark Mechanical](https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/mechanical-software).

I have three BOMs listed. BOM-Prototype is the BOM for the prototype version I'm working on now. BOM-PoweredWalking is the BOM for the version of the shoe that has cheaper components but should still be just as functional as the prototype version. BOM-OnlyPoweredBraking is the BOM for a downgraded version of the shoe that only has powered braking and no powered walking assistance.

I'm currently working on the prototype version. Once I have a prototype working I will work on getting the cheaper (BOM-PoweredWalking) version working. Then later I can try the powered braking version.

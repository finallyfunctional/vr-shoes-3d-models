# 3D Design File for Virtual Reality Motorized Shoe

**Note: This is a work in progress**

The vr-shoe is a "shoe" or platform that straps to each of your feet. The shoes function like a treadmill where as you walk you stay i the same location. With a treadmill you can only walk forward and backward, but with the vr shoes you can turn and walk in any direction.

The the vr shoes, along with a vr headset and saftey harness, are intended to be used while playing a vr game so that you can walk infintely in the game while staying in the same spot physically.

The design file is for [DesignSpark Mechanical](https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/mechanical-software).
